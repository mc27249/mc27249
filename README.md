# WHO AM I
My name is Mamadou Cisse, three  years ago while serving on active duty at a  remote location one  had an epiphany regarding the  direction the world is heading. At some point technology will be integrated into everything and humans well become more depended on technological advancement more than ever. It was at this moment that one had the vison of becoming a contributor in tech and not just a consumer.From there, one enrolled into Southern New Hampshire University Computer Science program to pursuit a bachelor’s degree. The journey is nearing a checkpoint, one has to say it has been a phenomenal experience. One went from writing  _Hello world!_ to fully  functional applications. One currently works as a SQL Server Engineer at Microsoft. Below are examples of  some of the important concepts that was learned during this experience and how one has progress through the years. 

# Assessment
As a student at SNHU, one concentrated on Software Engineering (SE). Problem solving and building things has always been an area of interest for one. One is driven by forward-momentum, what this means is that one is constantly looking forward to the next challenge. In the context of SE, one is obsess with the finding ways to improve current projects, no matter how small, the questions _what can I do to make it better?_ searching for this answer is what fuel one’s drive. There is always a room for improvement when it comes to software. 

The program at SNHU from the very first day challenged one to improve their skills, approach and view on problem solving. As result, one now writes and design codes that are up to industry standard. This can bee seen in the codes that accompany this portfolio. One has worked on multiple projects outside the classroom. However, with skills gained from the classroom, one has the capability to improve previously built project. Which can also be seen in the accompany code. This program has help solidify one’s strength, skill and most importantly a broad understanding of what SE. Concepts such as collaboration and security is often overlooked. One is fully aware of the importance of these concepts as they were emphasized throughout the coursework. To demonstrate one’s understanding, I’d like to reference CS 310.  A course fully dedicated to collaboration using Bitbucket. With over 15 students all working on the same repository and implement their choice of music into the code. One also had the option to review other students code and discuss what could be change or simply ask questions for clarification. C++ is one’s strongest language. while it offers performance advantages, it’s easy to introduce security flaw in one’s code if things are misused. C++ Pointers is a topic I spend lots of time on. They are powerful yet, subject to causing unauthorized memory access that can lead to other problems. Throughout the coursework one has invested time in areas such as code design, databases, data structure and algorithms, reviewing requirements from stakeholders. Time spend in these areas during the program as shape one’s professional goal and has prepared one for the challenges ahead.
