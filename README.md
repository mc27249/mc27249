# WHO AM I
My name is Mamadou Cisse, three  years ago while serving on active duty at a  remote location one  had an epiphany regarding the  direction the world is heading. At some point technology will be integrated into everything and humans well become more depended on technological advancement more than ever. It was at this moment that one had the vison of becoming a contributor in tech and not just a consumer.From there, one enrolled into Southern New Hampshire University Computer Science program to pursuit a bachelor’s degree. The journey is nearing a checkpoint, one has to say it has been a phenomenal experience. One went from writing  _Hello world!_ to fully  functional applications. One currently works as a SQL Server Engineer at Microsoft. Below are examples of  some of the important concepts that was learned during this experience and how one has progress through the years. 

# Assessment
As a student at SNHU, one concentrated on Software Engineering (SE). Problem solving and building things has always been an area of interest for one. One is driven by forward-momentum, what this means is that one is constantly looking forward to the next challenge. In the context of SE, one is obsess with the finding ways to improve current projects, no matter how small, the questions _what can I do to make it better?_ searching for this answer is what fuel one’s drive. There is always a room for improvement when it comes to software. 

The program at SNHU from the very first day challenged one to improve their skills, approach and view on problem solving. As result, one now writes and design codes that are up to industry standard. This can bee seen in the codes that accompany this portfolio. One has worked on multiple projects outside the classroom. However, with skills gained from the classroom, one has the capability to improve previously built project. Which can also be seen in the accompany code. This program has help solidify one’s strength, skill and most importantly a broad understanding of what SE is. Concepts such as collaboration and security is often overlooked. One is fully aware of the importance of these concepts as they were emphasized throughout the coursework. 

To demonstrate one’s understanding, I’d like to reference CS 310.  A course fully dedicated to collaboration using Bitbucket. With over 15 students all working on the same repository and implement their choice of music into the code. One also had the option to review other students code and discuss what could be change or simply ask questions for clarification. C++ is one’s strongest language. while it offers performance advantages, it’s easy to introduce security flaw in one’s code if things are misused. C++ Pointers is a topic I spend lots of time on. They are powerful yet, subject to causing unauthorized memory access that can lead to other problems. Throughout the coursework one has invested time in areas such as code design, databases, data structure and algorithms, reviewing requirements from stakeholders. Time spend in these areas during the program as shape one’s professional goal and has prepared one for the challenges ahead. 

# Artifacts
The artifacts that are presented here are to showcase one’s skill and the growth throughout the program. While the artifacts focus and emphasize the following areas: Software Design and Engineering, Data structure and Algorithms, Database. That not to say that other areas were ignore. Security in particular has been taking into consideration in all the artifacts and could not be emphasize enough. These areas are implemented in every application out there and its important that one has done work in these areas as a preparation to what’s to come. Below one will find a summary of the artifact and the work that was done. In addition, the code/projects can be downloaded for review. 

# Design
The artifact used to demonstrate one’s understanding of design is titled _AccountApp_. This is a project that initially began outside the classroom back in March 2019. After a while one revisited the project and the room for improvement was huge. This gave one the opportunity to incorporated into classroom work. The project is  a simple program that implement object oriented programming inherence concept  by using an account which is a base class and saving account, checking account and trust account  which are all derived classes. Users perform basic operation such as deposit, withdraw and display balance. The initial design of this project is extremely poor, but one was not aware of this at the time. Although the code is functional, everything is cramped in a single main.ccp file, which makes the code difficult to maintain, reused, and difficult to read and dissect. 

To improve the design of the project, one implemented new skills learned throughout the program such as making use of header files, hide majority of the code and make reference call. This truncated the main.ccp file and it looks cleaner. The readability is off the chart, and the code can easily be modified and reused. Both the original and enhance code are provide for download

# Data Structure and Algorithms

The artifact used here to demonstrate this concept is part of the Account application that was mentioned above. However, there is a separate downloadable for the code, one did not include the entire project but, simply the methods were the concepts were implemented. Initially the project was design with arrays of accounts. Upon later review, one realized that the project can be improved given the limitation of arrays. One, arrays fixed in size. While this is not an issue now, in an event where one needs space for more accounts then what’s allocated, one would have to go back to the source code and change the max size and recompile the code. This too costly and could be avoided.

As a method of improvement on modified the code to use using vector as the data type, which is a dynamic array with lots of cool functions. This improved the artifact by avoiding the allocation of unnecessary storage space, the accounts can grow and shrink in size at runtime and it gives the ability to use methods that provide bounds checking. This allow one to delete some of the code that was being used for tracking number of accounts It’s important to keep in mind that this is in context of C++. Other modern languages would not experience this issue with arrays. With similar semantics and syntax for array and vector, the changes were still challenging to implement. It important to understand the limitations and advantages of what’s in one’s code.
